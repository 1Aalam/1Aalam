👋 Hi, I’m @1Aalam. I am a passionate and motivated student of mechatronics engineering with a great desire to invent and develop new technologies. My experience in this area has given me a strong foundation in mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer science, which has enabled me to take on challenging challenges that lie at the nexus of these fields. I have a strong interest in robotics, automation, and control systems, therefore I'm always looking for chances to put my knowledge and abilities to use in solving problems in the real world.

I have deliberately sought out practical experiences throughout my academic career to supplement my theoretical understanding. I have taken a number of project-based courses where I have worked in diverse teams to design, construct, and test innovative systems.
